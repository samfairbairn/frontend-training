# Introduction

### Purpose

A number of our projects use the same set of frontend tools, vue.js, es6 with babel, npm, webpack to name a few.

The purpose of this training is not to provide in-depth training on the frontend tech available but rather to break apart our own dev environment into it's essential tools to provide some clarity and understanding of each tools role and how to leverage/modify/manage them effectively within our environment. The goal is for you to feel confident building complex webapp/h5 experiences from scatch.

### Overview

This training assumes no formal training but does expect some working knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Developers can come into the role through different paths and experiences, and therefore knowledge of core concepts is often reverse-engineered, for example I was familiar with jQuery long before I learned basic vanilla JS.

As a result some lessons may be covering old ground for you but I recommend going through them all anyway.
