# Introduction

### Purpose

A number of our projects use the same set of frontend tools, vue.js, es6 with babel, npm, webpack to name a few.

The purpose of this training is not to provide an in-depth study of the frontend tech available but rather to break apart our own dev environment into it's essential tools to provide some clarity and understanding of each tool's role and how to leverage/modify/manage them effectively within our environment, and also to act as a sort of refresher or directory of useful code that you can call upon when you're working on a project.

The end goal is for you to feel confident building complex webapp/h5 experiences from scratch.

### Structure

We will start each lesson with some online resources to read through, no point in reinventing the wheel right! Then I'll include a short recap, you can use this as a quick refresher and a code reference with snippets you can copy and paste into your projects. Followed by a short exercise to help you understand what you've learned. At the end I'll include some more in-depth articles that you can read if you have time and want to become a super expert smarty-pants brain-box developer.

*This training does expect some working knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript but not any formal training, as a result some lessons may be covering old ground for you but I recommend going through them all anyway.*
